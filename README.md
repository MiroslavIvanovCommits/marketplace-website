# :shopping: Clothing deals

Link to the site âžœ [Clothing Deals](https://marketplace-website-beta.vercel.app/)

A web page where you can share the best clothing deals you have found with other people, saving them time and money for free.<br/>
You can check all posts without the need of having website registration, thus giving you more options to protect your privacy and security online.

### Application has the following functionalities:
- `Home page(/)` with quick buttons for registration and about information.
- `About page(/about)`
- `Catalog page(/catalog)` where you can access all posts and their corresponding detail pages.
- `Stats page(/stats)` where you can check the total number of posts and site visits for the last month.
- `Login page(/login)` where you can log in.
- `Register page(/register)` where you can sign up.
- `Logout page(/logout)` which logs the current user out and redirects to the Home page.
- `Details page(/details/:postId)` with likes count and description of the post, option to like it if the user is register and options to edit and delete if the user is also the owner.
- `Create page(/create)` for adding a new post.
- `Edit page(/edit/:postId)` for editing an existing post.
- `Delete page(/delete/:postId)` for deleting and existing post.
- `Like button` for liking another user's posts.
- `Header` with navbar for easy navigation.
- `Footer` with additional referances.
- `Error404 page` for unvalid addresses.

Unregistered Visitors can access the following pages: `Home`, `About`, `Catalog`, `Stats`, `Details`, `Login`, `Register`.

If the Visitor registers, he'll become User. The User can access the following pages: `Home`, `About`, `Catalog`, `Stats`, `Details`, `Create`, `Logout`, `Edit`, `Delete` and can also like other user's posts (`Edit` and `Delete` only if the User is the creator of the post and `like` functionality only if he is not the creator).

Once registered, using the `Create page` takes you to a form where you can submit only after filling it with valid information. There is a verification. The deal name must be between 8 and 60 characters long, description must be between 30 and 2000 characters long, valid imageUrl must be provided and deal type selected<br/>
`Edit page` requires the same validations as `Create page`.<br/>
`Delete`... well deletes :wink:

The images and pdf files are uploaded to the deployed SoftUni practice server.

The site takes you to the `Error404 page` if you try to access a non-existent url.

The `Footer` has links to different social media pages, which, when clicked, will open in a new tab.
